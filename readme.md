# Staffing Pipeline

## Description 
This is a mini project conducted in parallel with Code Academy 2023. This is a portal which allows the Mckinsey employees to:
- view dashboards (charts, graphs and statistics of the studies)
- view practitioners
- view studies
- analyse and view case studies
- assigning studies to practitioners

The application has three types of users:
- Practitioners
- Leaders
- PD Team

The application includes role based access, hence each type of user has its own functionality. The functionality of each type of user is given as follows:

### Practitioners
The practitioners can:
- view the studies
- view the other practitioners
- view the case studies
- edit tech stack (based on sub-role of the practitioner like team lead, architect, etc.)

### Leaders 
The leaders can:
- view the studies
- view the other practitioners
- view the case studies
- view statistics, charts and graphs of studies and contributions 

### PD Team
The members of the PD Team can:
- assign the studies to practitioners
- view the studies 
- view the other users
- view the case studies and add case studies
